# welcome to Aakriti's Tech Café  ☕️

Hey there! I’m Aakriti Agarwal. I’m currently a student (soon to be a college student). This blog is basically my personal tech journal where I’ll be serving up a mix of tech treats - stuff I build, stuff I break (accidentally, I swear), and cool things I stumble upon while procrastinating productively.

Right now I’m messing around with Blender (the 3D kind, not the smoothie one),exploring the magical world of game dev with Godot, and trying to wrap my head around JavaScript without losing my sanity.

If you're into these (or just want to see what I’m up to), you're totally welcome to hang out here 💌

*3D models in Blender, bugs in Godot, errors in JavaScript - just another productive hour.*
